This is a list of available fantasy consoles/computers. Including softwares which simulate virtual hardwares, with limited functionality. And always encourage creating and sharing tiny retro games and programs with built-in languages and tools.

People find it difficult to search this kind of software to play with, so it is relaxed for choosing available consoles. However, it's fairly simple to tell if one is **not** a fantasy console/computer:

1. Hardware such as RaspberryPi and Gamebuino are not
2. Emulators (eg. NES, C64, DOSBox) are not
3. Generic graphics libraries and game engines are not
4. Programming IDEs and editors are not
5. Games like Minecraft and Terraria are not
